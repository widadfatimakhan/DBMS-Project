# Cinema Ticket Booking System

## Overview
This is a **Cinema Ticket Booking System**, developed as a university Database Management Systems (DBMS) project.  
The system allows customers to browse movies, select showtimes, submit bookings, view their booking history, and cancel bookings — all via a **PyQt6 GUI application** connected to a SQL Server database.

This project demonstrates **GUI development, database integration, and customer workflow management**.
